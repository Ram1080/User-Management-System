# User-Management-System
Objective: Create a RESTful API to manage user data without using Express.js.

Tasks:
Implement the following endpoints using the http module:
GET /users: Return a list of all users stored in a JSON file.
POST /users: Accept new user data in the request body and add it to the JSON file.
DELETE /users/:id: Remove a user by their ID from the JSON file.
Use the fs module to store and retrieve user data persistently.
Test the API using Postman or curl.
